I’m an IT Solutions Manager based in Singapore since 2010, originally from the Philippines. I’m passionate about creating impactful technology solutions and exploring innovations that transform how we work and live.

Outside of work, I’m a travel and food enthusiast—drawn to beautiful beaches, rich cultures, and unforgettable flavors. Thailand, Japan, and Boracay are some of my happy places.

I have a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), Agentic AI, and emerging tools that empower people, spark creativity, and open new possibilities for the future.
